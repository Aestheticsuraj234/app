Certainly! Here are the formulas for calculating the completion percentages for Problems, Chapters, Steps, and the DSA Sheet, formatted clearly:

### 1. **Completion Percentage for Problems:**

\[
\text{Completion Percentage for Problems} = \left(\frac{\text{Solved Problems}}{\text{Total Problems}}\right) \times 100
\]

### 2. **Completion Percentage for Chapters:**

\[
\text{Completion Percentage for Chapters} = \left(\frac{\text{Chapters with Solved Problems}}{\text{Total Chapters}}\right) \times 100
\]

   If you want to reflect the completion based on problems solved per chapter:

\[
\text{Completion Percentage for Chapters} = \left(\frac{\text{Total Solved Problems}}{\text{Total Problems per Chapter}}\right) \times 100
\]

### 3. **Completion Percentage for Steps:**

\[
\text{Completion Percentage for Steps} = \left(\frac{\text{Total Solved Problems in Step}}{\text{Total Problems in Step}}\right) \times 100
\]

   Alternatively, if you want to calculate based on chapters with solved problems:

\[
\text{Completion Percentage for Steps} = \left(\frac{\text{Chapters with Solved Problems}}{\text{Total Chapters in Step}}\right) \times 100
\]

### 4. **Completion Percentage for DSA Sheet:**

\[
\text{Completion Percentage for DSA Sheet} = \left(\frac{\text{Steps with Progress}}{\text{Total Steps}}\right) \times 100
\]

These formulas should help you accurately represent the completion status at various levels of your DSA content hierarchy.
